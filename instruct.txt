right now in this script file, python is able to read image 
data as PIL format with shape(80,80). the image is designed 
to be binary - 2D CT scan of rocks. Binary means pixels 
while and black. black pixels represent solid and white pixels 
represent voids - aka pores and throats inside porous medium image.

the ultimate goal is to treat this image as a simulation container,
 to see how permeable this medium is. Single-phase permeability, 
 often called absolute permeability (k), quantifies a porous 
 medium's ability to transmit a single fluid phase through 
 its pore space. It is an intrinsic property of the medium and 
 depends only on the geometry and connectivity of the pores, 
 not on the type of fluid used (as long as there are no 
 interactions like adsorption or capillary effects). 

so for absolute permeability simulation for this PIL format image
there are several steps need to be done:

firstly:
create mesh for this image using voxeltoFoam
set up void space as empty phases space (maybe air)
and set up solid space as boundary (non-slipping)

secondly:
run solver and set up invasion phase as water
