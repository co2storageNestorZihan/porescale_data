# Artificially Generated Binary Images for Porous Media Research

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of artificially generated binary images for porous media fluid flow research. These images are **not** real sandstone CT scans but artificial-generated simulation data specifically designed for porous media simulation studies.

## Dataset Contents

### 2D Binary Images
- Located in the `sample_blobs` folder
- Contains 10 2D blob images
- Porosity ranges from 0.1 to 0.9
- These images can be used for 2D porous media flow simulations and analysis

### 3D Binary Image
- Also located in the `sample_blobs` folder
- Provides a complete 3D porous structure
- Suitable for more complex 3D fluid flow simulations

## Reference Simulation

The `simulate.ipynb` Jupyter notebook demonstrates examples of completed simulation workflows for the 3D binary image, including:
- Absolute permeability calculations
- Relative permeability analysis
- Other relevant porous media property calculations
