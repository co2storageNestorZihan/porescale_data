right now in this script file, python is able to read image 
data as PIL format with shape(80,80). the image is designed 
to be binary - 2D CT scan of rocks. Binary means pixels 
while and black. black pixels represent solid and white pixels 
represent voids - aka pores and throats inside porous medium image.

the ultimate goal is to treat this image as a simulation container,
 to see how permeable this medium is. Single-phase permeability, 
 often called absolute permeability (k), quantifies a porous 
 medium's ability to transmit a single fluid phase through 
 its pore space. It is an intrinsic property of the medium and 
 depends only on the geometry and connectivity of the pores, 
 not on the type of fluid used (as long as there are no 
 interactions like adsorption or capillary effects). 

so for absolute permeability simulation for this PIL format image
there are several steps need to be done:

Preparing the Image and Meshing
First, use Python with the porespy library to read the 
PIL image, stack it to 3D (e.g., 80x80x2), and 
save as a .vti file. Then, use Paraview visualize the vti file.
i think original image is already binary so no need to threshold the 
image into segmented phases.


 there are some existing code for your reference:

 to_vtk
to_vtk(im, filename, divide=False, downsample=False, voxel_size=1, vox=False)[source]
Converts an array to a vtk file.


there are two websites that you need read them for reference:
